I investigate the intricacies of human perception and action and translate these insights into machine perception models. As a Lecturer at the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/cmai/people/iroman/) of Queen Mary University of London, I explore the nexus between human behavior and AI. Within Queen Mary, I am a member of the Center for Multimodal AI, Center for Digital Music, Center for Human-Centered Computing, the Computer Vision group, and the Cognitive Science group. My work has a foundation in biology, signal processing, and linguistics, challenging conventional views of human cognition to discover mechanisms that can inform novel insights for AI models.

My research has particularly looked at human actions with rhythmic events. Traditional Bayesian models fall short in capturing this, leading me to propose models anchored in “strong anticipation.” These non-linear oscillator-based models illuminate the behavioral nuances between musicians and non-musicians, a contribution recognized by [Stanford’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence award](https://stanforddaily.com/2019/05/01/stanfords-human-centered-ai-institute-awards-30-seed-grants/).

In the realm of machine learning, I aim to enhance models for spatial perception by harnessing acoustic imaging and computer vision. I've advanced models for sound source distance and direction of arrival estimation. More recently, I have been developing new models for multimodal machine perception that can recognize and track object states in dynamic scenes. My contributions extend to open-source projects like `librosa`, `spatialscaper`, `mirdata`, and `micarraylib`. Parallel to academia, my research has found applications in product development at companies such as Apple, Tesla, Raytheon/BBN, and Plantronics. My research has also been funded by NSF, DARPA, and HHMI.

Are you interested in joining me at Queen Mary? I am recruiting Ph.D. candidates and postdocs. I am also recruiting students who are already at Queen Mary (undergrad, masters, or doctorate). Temporary visiting positions are also possible for researchers from other institutions at all levels of expertise. Please email me your CV and let's talk about open positions (i.roman \<a\> qmul.ac.uk)
