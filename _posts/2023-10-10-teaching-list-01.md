In the quiet streets of the Mexican countryside, at the tender age of 12, my journey as an educator began. Every week, I would sit with 5th graders, delving into the world of short stories, unraveling plots and deciphering characters. The spark ignited further when, at 14, I founded the “Escuela de Música Rosa Victoria” in my parent's garage. Overseeing the musical journey of more than 50 students, I crafted materials that bridged musical notes with emotions. Observing my students master instruments and solfege, a curiosity arose within me – a yearning to understand the nuances of learning. This intrigue led me across borders to the University of North Texas (UNT) on a student visa, where I pursued my passions in Music and Biology as an undergrad.

At UNT, my innate drive to teach found new avenues. From organizing study groups to formally teaching Genetics and Microbiology labs, my undergraduate years were filled with moments of enlightenment and inspiration. The trust my professors, like Dr. Pamela Padilla and the late Mrs. Roxana Hughes, placed in me was both an honor and a responsibility. Their guidance and the pedagogical tools I acquired, such as the project-based instruction (PBI) framework, allowed me to innovate in the classroom. 

Yet, every teaching approach comes with its challenges. While PBI enhanced individual learning, it sometimes curtailed student interaction. Stanford, however, offered a remedy. Assisting Dr. Julius Smith in the vibrant classes on digital signal processing, I was introduced to the art of live-coding sessions. These sessions transformed the classroom into a lively forum, encouraging students from diverse disciplines to ideate, collaborate, and innovate. This atmosphere not only fostered interdisciplinary collaborations but also sparked novel research ideas.

My teaching philosophy has always been anchored in the belief that every student, regardless of their background or expertise, can thrive with the right guidance. Inspired by Lev Vygotsky's educational theories, I recognized the significance of scaffolding in education. At Stanford, I meticulously designed problems with partial solutions, providing students the necessary framework to construct their understanding. Whether it was during the interactive sessions or one-on-one office hours, I reveled in witnessing those "Aha! I get it" moments, affirming the impact of tailored guidance.

Reflecting on my journey, from the young educator in Mexico to the passionate teaching assistant at Stanford, I am reminded of the countless students who've inspired me, the mentors who've shaped my perspective, and the myriad experiences that have solidified my aspiration to be a lifelong mentor and educator. Each chapter of my teaching journey, whether it was the elementary school in Mexico, the labs at UNT, or the classes at Stanford, has been a testament to my belief in the transformative power of education.
