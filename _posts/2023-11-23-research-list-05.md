[Washburn A, Román I, Huberth M, Gang N, Dauer T, Reid W, Nanou C, Wright M, Fujioka T. Musical role asymmetries in piano duet performance influence alpha-band neural oscillation and Behavioral synchronization. Frontiers in neuroscience. 2019 Oct 15;13:1088.](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~iran/papers/Washburn_et_al_FN_2019.pdf)
Recent work in interpersonal coordination has revealed that neural oscillations, occurring spontaneously in the human brain, are modulated during the sensory, motor, and cognitive processes involved in interpersonal interactions. We employed music ensemble performance to evaluate patterns of behavioral and neural activity when roles between co-performers are systematically varied with complete counterbalancing.

During joint action tasks, expectations for outcomes of one’s own and other’s actions are collectively monitored. Recent evidence suggests that trait empathy levels may also influence performance monitoring processes. The present study investigated how outcome expectation and empathy interact during a turn-taking piano duet task, using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording.

In the motor system, desynchronization of oscillatory activity in the beta band (20Hz) is observed through periodic somatosensory and/or auditory stimulation. We developed a neural model of nonlinear oscillators that transforms stimuli into characteristic oscillatory activity of the beta band.

When humans receive musical training, the neural sub- strates associated with production and processing of music undergo functional changes. This study investigates whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can identify changes in the neural dynamics of an adult that received musical training.

[Jiménez JE, Crego RD, Soto GE, Roman IR, Rozzi R, Vergara PM. Potential impact of the alien American mink (Neovison vison) on Magellanic woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) in Navarino Island, Southern Chile. Biological Invasions. 2014 Apr;16:961-6.](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~iran/papers/Jimenez_et_al_BI_2013.pdf)
The American mink (_Neovison vison_) has been described as one of the worst invasive species in the northern hemisphere. Although some studies on the mink exist for the southern hemisphere, aside from impacts on marine and freshwater birds, its effect on other components of the biota is not well understood.
