My research pioneers robust sound distance estimation and new 
representations for sound event localization and detection (SELD). 
In a paper presented at the 2023 IEEE Workshop on Applications of 
Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics, I introduced a new model
for sound source distance estimation (Kushwaha et al., 2023). 
We compiled a dataset consisting of real-world and open-source 
tetrahedral microphone recordings, captured in different geographical locations.
We focused on understanding and mitigating distance estimation error. 
Experiments showed the benefit of supervising model learning by converting 
error into a percentage of the ground truth distance. We significantly outperformed 
baseline approaches on the LOCATA benchmark, and we also evaluated our model's 
performance on many other datasets.

| *Model performance in sound source distance estimation is optimal when using a percentage- based loss: AE = abs error; APE= abs % error; TAPE = thresh- olded APE (Î´ = threshold)* |

My work also propels sound direction of arrival (DoA) estimation forward by 
optimizing acoustic imaging from low-resolution tetrahedral microphone arrays. 
To achieve this, my co-authors and I
leverage computer vision super-resolution models that
can upsample low-resolution arrays to high-resolution.
The result is a spherical heatmap that describes sound
source provenance. This representation allowed us to train a 
recurrent neural network that can carry out DoA. A detailed ablation study led to 
an optimal model displaying state-of-the-art performance on the LOCATA and 
STARSS2023 benchmarks (Roman et al., 2024).
My work also has leveraged acoustic signals to estimate room size (Liang et al., 2023).
