I administer [MusicInformationRetrieval.com](https://MusicInformationRetrieval.com).

A bit of a backstory: I met [Steve Tjoa](https://www.stevetjoa.com) during my time as a PhD student at CCRMA. While Steve was teaching the MIR summer workshop, I was leading the Deep Learning for MIR one.

In August 2023, Steve and I met in Manhattan (at a coffee shop near NYU), where he graciously passed on the reins of this website and its corresponding GitHub repository to me. I'm honored by his trust.

Please rest assured, the project will continue in the same spirit and no major changes are foreseen.

I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Steve for his invaluable contributions to the field and for entrusting me with this responsibility.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at iran \<at\> ccrma \<dot\> stanford \<dot\> edu.
